# Navigating Success: Choosing the Right College Major

## Introduction

Want to be successful? Choose the right path. This project aims to provide insights into selecting college majors that lead to high-paying jobs. Leveraging data analysis techniques, we delve into the recent-grads dataset, examining job outcomes for students who graduated between 2010 and 2012.

### Key Questions Explored:

1. Which majors lead to the highest-paying jobs?
2. What majors have the highest and lowest employment rates?
3. How many majors are predominantly male or female?
4. Is there a relationship between majors with a high percentage of females and salary?

### Dataset Information:

**Data Source:** American Community Survey  
**Technologies Used:** Pandas, NumPy, seaborn, Matplotlib, Python, DateTime module

## Project Overview

### Background:

This analysis stemmed from the quest to guide my cousin sister in her pursuit of selecting a college major that promises financial success. Instead of relying on online blogs, I decided to employ data analysis skills to provide well-informed answers and reasoning.

### Data Collection:

The recent-grads.csv dataset contains job outcomes of college graduates from 2010 to 2012, sourced from the American Community Survey. This dataset, curated by FiveThirtyEight, serves as our primary data source.

### Methodology:

1. Data Cleaning: Removed rows with missing values to ensure accurate analysis.
2. Data Exploration: Utilized visualizations (scatter plots, histograms, bar plots) to answer key questions.
3. Analysis: Investigated relationships between variables to draw meaningful insights.

## Conclusion & Insights

### Key Findings:

1. Popular majors don't necessarily equate to higher salaries.
2. Majors with a majority of female graduates tend to result in lower median earnings.
3. No significant link exists between full-time employment and median salary.
4. Approximately 76 majors are predominantly male, while 96 are predominantly female.

### Major Recommendations:

- **Stick to Engineering and Technology:** These majors often lead to higher-paying jobs and have a lower share of female students.
- **Consider Male-Dominated Majors:** Women may stand out in male-dominated fields, leveraging trends like #girlpower and #equalpay.

### Conclusion:

By leveraging data analysis, we've unveiled valuable insights into selecting college majors for future success. From identifying high-paying fields to understanding gender dynamics, this analysis serves as a guide for informed decision-making in higher education.
