# Want to be successful? Choose the right path.

In this analysis I have used the recent-grads data on the job outcomes of students who graduated from college between 2010 and 2012, for answering 
 questions related to choosing college majors.
 
**What are the majors that lead to the highest-paying jobs?**

**What are the majors with the maximum employment rate and with the least employment rate?** 

**How many majors are predominantly male and Predominantly female?**

**What is the relationship between majors having the maximum percentage of females and the salary.**
Datasource: American Community Survey
Technology used: Pandas, NumPy, seaborn, Matplotlib, Python, DateTime module
